# Market Challenges - Web3

-----------------------
Platforms like Zealy, Questn, and Galxe attempt to engage users through token economics, involving token airdrops, NFT minting, and stablecoin rewards. However, these methods face critical issues:

- Not being in the presence of your own ecosystem: Lack of interested user conversion starting from just a website or application visitor. Engagement platforms are biased on their own community count, user-base and quality. Projects sacrifice their potential for short term and low quality user gain.
- Liquidity Concerns and Unsustainable Growth: Relying on token economics for user engagement leads to liquidity challenges, hindering long-term sustainability. Projects struggle to consistently offer valuable liquid assets, and distributing low-utility NFTs fails to encourage meaningful engagement with on-chain products.
- Inadequate Gamification and Customer Retention: Existing strategies lack effective gamification elements that resonate with users, resulting in poor customer retention rates. The absence of compelling incentives makes it difficult to maintain user interest and participation over time.
- Limited Impact of Precision Marketing Tools: Tools that utilize on-chain data and analytics for precision marketing have not demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing user growth or retention, offering limited actionable insights.
