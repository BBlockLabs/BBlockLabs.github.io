# Market Challenges - Traditional Marketing Channels

-----------------------
The effectiveness of traditional marketing channels in promoting on-chain activities is dwindling due to several key factors:

- **Information Saturation**: The overwhelming volume of content on social media platforms makes it increasingly difficult for Web3 initiatives to capture attention.
- **Misaligned Incentives**: These platforms are designed to maximize internal engagement, often neglecting the promotion of external, on-chain activities.
- **Centralized Control**: The centralized governance of content on these platforms conflicts with the decentralized ethos of Web3, limiting the reach and impact of marketing efforts.
- **Opaque Acquisition Costs**: The complexity and lack of transparency in measuring customer acquisition costs obstruct effective marketing planning.
- **Uncertain Engagement Outcomes**: The correlation between social media growth and actual on-chain engagement remains uncertain, offering no guarantees of user activity.
