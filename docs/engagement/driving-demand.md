Furthermore, BonusBlock establishes an interconnected system between ecosystems and campaigns, acting as a pivotal bridge for user activity. Beyond campaign creation, BonusBlock offers a comprehensive infrastructure equipped with analysis tools and an automated process for verifying user on-chain activities across Web3. This system significantly eases project burdens by automating mission completion and criteria verification through smart contracts, governed by reward mechanisms and pools, and is supported by a diverse set of RPC node providers.
