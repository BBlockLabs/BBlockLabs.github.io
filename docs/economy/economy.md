# The BonusBlock Economy

-----------------------
The native token of BonusBlock, designated as $BONUS, acts as a utility and governance token for the Marketplace and the BonusBlock ecosystem:

**Utility**: accessing the Marketplace with users being exposed to projects, earning fees and yield on activities that projects have paid for, early access to blue-chip projects, profile listing and as a fee module.
**Governance**: regulating decisions on the fee distribution module, participation in the marketplace economy

## Participation in the Marketplace economy
Holders of $BONUS tokens have the privilege of gaining visibility from projects. The higher the wallet quality, the higher the “$” is presented to projects. To participate in the fee distribution when a project acquires a user, there are requirements to lock in $BONUS at least minimum of $75. 

## Regulating fee distribution to quality users from projects paid fee
The Fee Multiplier is determined by the amount of $BONUS tokens a user has locked in. A linear relationship is taking in place between multiplier and the locked amount)

## Boosted Community XP Rewards for Locked $BONUS
The amount of Community XP tokens earned per mission can vary among users based on the quantity of $BONUS tokens they have locked. The locked $BONUS amount is directly proportional to the user's ratio against the circulating supply. See examples: 

<div className="text-center flex-content-center no-space">

| User   | Locked $BONUS                     | Locked Ratio against circulating supply\* | Ratio increase |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|
| User 1 | 100 000<br/>(equivalent to $5000) | 0.0083%                                   | x 0.11         |
| User 2 | 40 000                            | 0.0033%                                   | x 0.07         |

| User 6 | 6 000                             | x…                                        | x 0.011        |
| User 7 | 4 000                             | …                                         | x 0.007        |

\* (assuming 12% is circulated, 12,000,000)
</div>
**NOTE: price is only as a representation of providing examples of the formula use.**

User 1, who locks in 100,000 $BONUS tokens (equivalent to $5,000), secures a 0.0083% ratio against the circulating supply, resulting in a ratio increase factor of x 0.11 for Community XP tokens earned. Conversely, users locking in smaller amounts, such as User 8 with 2,000 $BONUS tokens, sees a lower ratio increase factor of x 0.003.

This sliding scale incentivizes users to lock in higher amounts of $BONUS tokens to gain a more substantial increase in Community XP tokens per mission, enhancing their rewards and engagement within the ecosystem.

| Bonding    | 10 (equivalent to $2) |
