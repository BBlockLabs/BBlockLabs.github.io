# About BonusBlock

-----------------------
BonusBlock initially started in early 2023 as a protocol for on-chain engagement and user onboarding solution providers. The focus is to enable ecosystems to attract, onboard, establish relationships and advance the newly onboarded users towards exploring the application layer and functionalities they offer.

Being a multi-chain project, offering various flexibility, BonusBlock scaled into becoming a recognized player in various networks for bringing on-chain value and fresh user activity.

Working with such projects like Injective, XION by Burnt, Nibiru, EclipseFi, Axelar, Synthr, Archway, Elys Network, GOV.DAO, Landslide, Oraichain, Midnight Evergreen, Axelar, Kasu Finance, RTF, Unigrid, Solcial and more!
