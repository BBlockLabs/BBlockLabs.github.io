# XP and Token Strategy within Economic Model

-----------------------
With a 50% ratio of community XP points across all campaigns and Marketplace, Community XP points will have significant value in participating in the $BONUS token Community Access
pool while also having $BONUS for utility.

## Community XP and $BONUS Token Dynamics

The conversion of Community XP to $BONUS tokens for participation in the Community Access Pool is governed by a specific arithmetic formula, ensuring a fair and transparent
distribution mechanism:

<div className="text-center flex-content-center no-space">
_R<sub>XP</sub>_ = <span className="frac">_<span>XP<sub>total</sub></span>_<span className="symbol">/</span><span className="bottom">_<span>BONUS<sub>minted</sub></span>_</span></span>
<br/>
_BONUS<sub>USER</sub>_ = <span className="frac">_<span>XP<sub>commit</sub></span>_<span className="symbol">/</span><span className="bottom">_<span>R<sub>XP</sub></span>_</span></span>
<br/>
_BONUS<sub>USER</sub>_ = <span className="frac"><span>5000</span><span className="symbol">/</span><span className="bottom">100</span></span> = 500
<br/>
_V<sub>BONUS</sub>_ = _BONUS<sub>USER</sub>_ &times; _P<sub>BONUS</sub>_ 
<br/>
_V<sub>discount</sub>_ = <span className="frac"><span>_V<sub>BONUS</sub>_</span><span className="symbol">/</span><span className="bottom">2</span></span>
</div>

## Value Proposition and Discounts
This example illustrates the strategic implementation of the dual-token system within BonusBlock's ecosystem, showcasing how Community XP points and $BONUS tokens interact to facilitate access, utility, and value capture through our economic and vesting model. In this example, the price of $BONUS is set at $4.10 (used as a reference for calculation purposes only).

**XP to $BONUS Conversion:**
- Let's assume, 1 $BONUS is equivalent to 100 XP. 
  - This ratio will be governed by how much Community XP is minted along the way, keeping a steady growth.)
  - It's important to note that this ratio can change based on the amount of Community XP being created.

**User Commitment Example:**
- If a user commits 5000 XP:
  - Converts into 500 $BONUS tokens (because 5000 XP ÷ 100 XP/$BONUS = 500 $BONUS).
  - This equates to a value of $2050 (because 500 $BONUS × $4.10/$BONUS = $2050).
  - With a 50% discount, $1025 will be required in $ETH, $USDT, or $USDC to be bonded with Community XP.

With the current $BONUS price set at $4.10, users converting 5000 XP would acquire 500 $BONUS tokens, equivalent to $2050 in value. A 50% discount mechanism allows users to bond this amount with $ETH, $USDT, or $USDC for half the price, i.e., $1025, enhancing the appeal and accessibility of $BONUS tokens.

## Distribution and Participation Incentives
The BonusBlock dual-token system encourages the bonding of Community XP and liquid tokens, rewarding users with a proportional amount of $BONUS tokens. A hard cap ensures equitable participation across the community, benefiting both high and low contributors. Community XP directly correlates with user activity, driving engagement and fostering a dynamic ecosystem growth.

This model underscores the innovative approach to token distribution and engagement, leveraging Community XP as a pivotal element in the economic and participatory dynamics of the ecosystem.

## Token Release and Vesting Strategy
A structured release schedule, aligned with user growth, controls access to token unlocks, with 45% of the total token supply being restricted. This approach significantly limits market exposure while enabling community members to acquire and retain a substantial portion of the tokens, promoting a healthy and sustainable token economy.

## Showcase: An Example of $BONUS Distribution Dynamics.
This scenario delineates how a total committed community XP of 500,000 and liquid tokens amounting to $102,500 are allocated among users, reflecting their respective ownership percentages.
